## 📦 Building the Project

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.  
The production build optimizes the application for performance and speed.

##  Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests using the Karma test runner, run:

```bash
ng test
```

##  Running End-to-End Tests

To run end-to-end (e2e) tests, use:
